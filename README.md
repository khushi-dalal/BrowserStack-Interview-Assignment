# BrowserStack-Interview-Assignment
This Node.js project streams live updates from a log file to a web client using WebSocket. It mimics the `tail -f` UNIX command, sending only new content after the last read position to connected clients. Built with Express, it efficiently handles large files and supports multiple clients for dynamic log monitoring.
